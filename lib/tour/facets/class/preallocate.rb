  # This method is very similar to the idea of #prepend, but it has some
  # limitations in that it works by overriding #new and #allocate and extends
  # an object with the aspect modules on instantiation. A true #prepend
  # implementation would not have to do this --but would be a natural part
  # of the class heirarchy instead. For this reason, this method has been
  # named #preallocate, rather than #prepend.
