  # During this trying time when no one can get their
  # techie catchwords to stick to the refrigerator no
  # matter how hard they slap it with the enchanted
  # magnetic spatula, it’s good to know that the
  # contrived phrases really do fly, graceful and
  # unclasped and bearing north toward chilled shrimp.
  # I know what my Hallowe’en pumpkin is going to say.
