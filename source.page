# Contribution Guidelines

The widely accepted practice of contributing to GitHub projects entails:

* Fork rubyworks/facets
* Create a topic branch: git checkout -b my_fix
* Make your changes
* Push your branch: git push origin my_fix
* Open an Issue referencing your branch.
* Please do not push to master on your fork!

Following this procedure will make everyone’s life easier.

As with all good libraries, testing is vital. Facets handles testing via two different
libraries. Lemon is used for unit testing and QED is used for behavior specifications.
Lemon was actaully designed specifially for Ruby Facets which forces tests to be on
a per-method basis. QED is a tool for literate BDD. In fact Facets inline 
docuemtation is fully executable via QED.
