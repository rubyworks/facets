== Description
   This module provides Java style interfaces for Ruby, including a fairly
   similar syntax.  I don't necessarily believe in interfaces, but I wanted to
   put it out there as proof that it could be done.  Frankly, Java needs mixins
   more than Ruby needs interfaces, but here you go.

== Installation

=== Manual
   rake install
   
=== Gem Install
   gem install interface

== Synopsis
   require "interface"
	
   MyInterface = interface{
      required_methods :foo, :bar, :baz
   }
	
   # Raises an error until 'baz' is defined
   class MyClass
      def foo
         puts "foo"
      end
      def bar
         puts "bar"
      end
      implements MyInterface
   end
   
== General Notes
   Subinterfaces work as well.  See the test_sub.rb file under the 'test'
   directory for a sample.

== Developer's Notes
   A discussion on IRC with Mauricio Fernandez got us talking about traits.
   During that discussion I remembered a blog entry by David Naseby.  I 
   revisited his blog entry (at http://homepages.ihug.com.au/~naseby/33.html)
   and took a closer look.

   Keep in mind that I also happened to be thinking about Java at the moment
   because of a recent job switch that involved coding in Java.  I was also
   trying to figure out what the purpose of interfaces were.

   As I read the first page of David Naseby's article I realized that,
   whether intended or not, he had implemented a rudimentary form of interfaces
   for Ruby.  When I discovered this, I talked about it some more with Mauricio
   and he and I (mostly him) fleshed out the rest of the module, including some
   syntax improvements.  The result is syntax and functionality that is nearly
   identical to Java.

   I should note that, although I am listed as the author, this was mostly the
   combined work of David Naseby and Mauricio Fernandez.  I just happened to be
   the guy that put it all together.

== Acknowledgements
   This module was largely inspired and somewhat copied from a post by
   David Naseby at http://homepages.ihug.com.au/~naseby/33.html.  It was
   subsequently modified almost entirely by Mauricio Fernandez through a
   series of discussions on IRC.
