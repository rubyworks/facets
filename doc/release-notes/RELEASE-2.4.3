= Release Notes -- 2.4.3

== Major Changes

* Changed File#rewrite to not use the in-place change of the string.
* Deprecate Hash#keys_to_s and Hash#keys_to_sym.
* Renamed Class#to_pathname and #to_methodname to #pathize and #methodize.
* Deprecated Console:: namespace for ANSICode.
* Added Time#trunc and Time#round to Core.
* Added Ken Bloom's DictionaryMatcher class (will be renamed in future version)
* Added Array#recursively and fixed bug in Hash#recursively.
* Added kernel/instance method which provides a fluent interface to private object space.
* Moved Mentalguy's lazy.rb to core!
* Added Indexable and Stackable to core.
* Deprecated ruby.rb, which was a sort 1.9 compatibility layer.
* The ruby.rb methods were moved to core, wrapped in a 1.9 condition.

== Minor Changes

* Fixed Time#hence changed years when changing months.
* Fixed Time#hence to flip year correctly when adding months.
* Added optional argument to Dictionary#first and #last.
* Improved File#rootname --it is now more robust.
* Made FileUtils#whereis a module_function again.
* Although not perceptible to the end user, there are now three divisions lib/core, lib/lore, lib/more.
* Created Lore library to house extensions to Ruby's standard library.

Note that this release does not include a setup.rb script. We are working
on a new version of this script, which we plan to include in the next release.

Special thanks to:

* Ken Bloom
* Nick Caruso
* Evgeniy Dolzhenko
* Andy Freeman
* Tomasz Muras
* Dave Myron

And of course, to anyone else I failed to mention that has contributed.

As a REMINDER, Facets 2.4+ now encourages:

  require 'facets'

This is better than cherry-picking methods. It may seem counter-intuitive,
but it actually proves more advantages to do this for the sake of
improved interoperability. The practice of cherry-picking can become 
problematic if other dependent libraries have cherry-picked different
methods. In those cases these distinctions go unaccounted and untested.

Facets is almost fully interoperable with ActiveSupport and Ruby 1.9.
We will continue to improve this interoperability in upcoming releases.
