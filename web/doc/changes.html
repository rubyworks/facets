            <h1>Change History</h1>
<h2>2.4.0 / 2008-03-24</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Console name space is being deprecated. command.rb and arguments.rb now
use CLI naemspace.

</li>
<li>#compare_on and #equate_on are now &quot;mixin methods&quot; Comparable()
and Equateable().

</li>
<li>Enumerable#product, #combintations and #permutations have change to be Ruby
1.9 compatible.

</li>
<li>thread.rb, map_send, et al, block is passed to send instead of yiedling on
result.

</li>
<li>namespace.rb has been renamed to methodspace.rb.

</li>
<li>Ruby 1.9 defined a new Proc#curry method, so Facets version has been made
compatible.

</li>
<li>The old curry method is now called #partial, as in &quot;partial
application&quot;.

</li>
<li>Deprecated interface.rb &#8212;it proved absolutely extraneous.

</li>
<li>Deprecated paramix.rb &#8212;a better way is to use a capitialize method.

</li>
<li>Brought back a few web related libs htmlfilter.rb and cssfilter.rb in
particular.

</li>
<li>This was a fairly large and fast-paced update, so not all changes are
listed. See RDocs to more information.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.3.0 / 2008-02-01</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reorganized library into smaller groups: core, more, class and mixin.

</li>
<li>Added tracepoint.rb back to the library.

</li>
<li>Fixed multiglob_r bug, so it will NOT follow symlinks.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.2.1 / 2007-12-22</h2>
<ul>
<li>Got rid of methods subdir. All method redirects are in core/.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.2.0 / 2007-12-13</h2>
<ul>
<li>A lot of rdoc updates to core extensions &#8212;as promised ;)

</li>
<li>Just about every method now has at least a brief explinaiton and an
example.

</li>
<li>integer/bitmask.rb has changed a bit &#8212;pun intended ;) Deprecated some
methods and now use &quot;~&quot; instead of &quot;-&quot; to clear bits.

</li>
<li>The name Array#unzip didn&#8217;t makes sense, it was renamed to #modulate
(though #collate seems better?)

</li>
<li>Renamed Enumerable#collate to #mash (Map hASH); #collate and #graph remain
aliases for the time being.

</li>
<li>Deprecated Module#include_and_extend. Just use both silly.

</li>
<li>More lib pp_s.rb has been removed. Use #pretty_inspect instead.

</li>
<li>Split binding extensions up a bit more finely &#8212;eval.rb sprouted
here.rb, self.rb and defined.rb.

</li>
<li>Move Time#stamp out of conversion.rb and into time/ dir, and remove to_s
alias.

</li>
<li>Preliminary addition of Matthew Harris&#8217; excellent duration.rb lib
(will integrate with times.rb better in future).

</li>
<li>Added if clauses to handle upcoming Ruby 1.9 gracefully. Facets should now
be just about ready for use with 1.9.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.1.3 / 2007-11-28</h2>
