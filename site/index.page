# Facets is the Premier Ruby Extensions Library

Ruby Facets was first released in 2005. Since then it has evolved into the
single largest and most refined core extensions library for the Ruby programming
language. All <i>facets</i> can be loaded with the single require or cherry-picked
individually. There are hundreds of quality methods in the collection which
have been derived from years of experience of dozens of top Ruby programmers.

In addition to the core libraries, Facets provides extensions to Ruby standard
library, as well as as a small collection of add-on classes and mixins.
Together with core extensions these libraries provide a broad general-purpose
set of components commonly useful across a wide variety of applications.


# Facets is for Every Ruby Developer

Who uses Facets? Lots of Rubyists do!

Many developers use Facets as a copy-and-paste resource, others use it as a dependency
cheery-picking just the methods they need, and still others use the library whole-clothe.
How you use Ruby Facets to facilitate your Ruby development is completely yours to decide.

# Facets is a Bright Idea

The philosophy of <span class="red">Facets</span> can be summed
up in a simple mantra, <b>ALL BASE COMMON</b>. The idea being, that by sharing a broad foundation
of general purpose code, the Ruby community will be better severd. There are a number of
advantages to this approach. Among them: name consistency, better code-reuse, collaborative
improvements and reduced installation requirements.

Facets also embodies the idea of "having it your way". You can use as much or as little
of Facets as you see fit. In fact, Ruby Facets originated the idea cherry-pickable extensions.


# Facets is a Community Effort

Facets is not the sole achievement of one person, but was made possible by the hard
work of many excellent programmers. Some persons contributed code directly, other's simply
had their code picked-up from another open resource. In either case, three cheeers
for all!
