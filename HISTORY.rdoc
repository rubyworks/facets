== 2.5.3 / 2009-07-03

Facets 2.5.3 fixes an arity bug with Module#extend --one of the
very few actual core overrides in Facets, and it removes htmlfilter.rb
due to a licensing incompatability.

* 2 Major Enhancements

    * Removed htmlfilter.rb due to licensing issues.
    * Also removed cssfilter.rb ('gem install htmlfilter' now)

* 1 Minor Enhancements

    * Removed Kernel#__HERE__ as it simply cannot work.
      (Ruby 1.9.2 will offer #source_location for the same,, btw.)

* 1 Bug Fixes

    * Fixed arity issue with Module#extend.


== 2.5.2 / 2009-04-07

Facets 2.5.2 is a simple maintentance release.

=== Changes

* 1 Major Enhancement

    * added string/uppercase and lowercase

* 1 Minor Enhancement

    * adjustemnts to to_hash.rb


== 2.5.1 / 2009-03-05

Facets 2.5.1 fixes a few bugs, makes some small but nice additions
and improves 1.9 compatibility.

The most important addition to make note of is Object#extend, which has
been overridden to allow a block parameter. This is one of only two or three
actual "monkey patches" in all of Facets. The block, when provided,
is used to create an annonymous module which then extends the reciever.
This is a "good practice" way to extend objects, rather than using class_eval
on the singleton class.

Special thanks to Erik Veenstra, Pit Capitan and especially Sandor Szücs
for their contributions to this release.

=== Changes

* 7 Major Enhancements

    * added Hash#group_by_value (thanks to Erik Veenstra)
    * added String#file
    * added Hash#new_with (Pit Capitan)
    * added module/extend.rb, now can take a block.
    * added hook.rb
    * added to_h_auto
    * overhauled to_hash.rb, now has multiple methods

* 10 Bug Fixes

    * corrected ostruct.rb to test for frozen state on updates
    * fixed String#left_align
    * fixed conflict between test_name.rb and test_arguments.rb
    * fixed Enumreable#split when reciever is empty array
    * fixed coruption of reciever by Hash#collate (thanks to Tilo Sloboda)
    * fixed Array#to_h, h={} was not initialized
    * fixed test of Module#conflict according ruby19
    * fixed Hash#dearray_singluar_values
    * association.rb stores reference when using #new
    * changed Array#product to make it compatible to ruby 19, deleted block parameter

* 5 Minor Enhancements

    * split enumerable/collect into map_with_index and compact_map
    * improved Array#to_h for 1.9 using flatten(1)
    * Dictionary#replace can take regular Hash too
    * move test_to_hash.rb from more to core
    * Doc'd that UnboundMethod#name returns Symbol in 1.9, but String in 1.8


== 2.5.0 / 2008-11-23

Facets 2.5.0 is an important milestone in the development of Facets.

This release has been tested against Rails' ActiveSupport library.
As long as Facets is loaded after ActiveSupport, everything
should work fine. Of course, there's no counting for real world
trials, but all ActiveSupport testcases pass under this scenario.

Secondly, this release is the first of two (or three) down-scaling
releases intended to remove all the remaining "excess" from the
library. This is being done for a variety of reasons. Some scripts
are substantial enough to be one their own and have been spun-off
into separate largely compatible projects. In this release:

  If you were using...   Use this project instead...

    annotations.rb         Anise

    bytes.rb               RichUnits
    times.rb

    command.rb             Clio
    consoleutils.rb

A few others scripts have been deprecated, without an alternative
recourse, simply because they were too weak, such as  uploadutils.rb,
or highly experimental, such as chain.rb and eventhook.rb.

Although this release constitutes an over all slimming down of Facets,
two excellent new libraries have been added.

1) *ini.rb* by Jeena Paradies. While YAML is frequently used by
Rubyists for configuration files, a full-on serializer like YAML
is often overkill. INI files provide a lightweight solution
specifically geared for configuration.

2) *filter.rb* by Brian Candler offers lazy evaluation chains of 
Enumerable methods. This is an elegant way to optimize contiguous
maps, selections, etc. --effective even on infinite enumerators.
(Note, the name of this library may be changed in the next release.)

While work remains to be done, I am happy to say, Facets is 
finally beginning to approach the level of solidity I set out to
achieve just over a year ago. Thank the Maker!

Special thanks to Brian Candler, Jeena Paradies and Tyler Rick.

* 9 Major Changes

    * added Brian Candler's Enumerator::Filter
    * added sparse_array.rb (was old harray.rb)
    * added Jeena Paradies' ini.rb
    * renamed CacheDelegator to Memoizer
    * renamed DictionaryMatcher to just Matcher
    * deprecated bytes.rb and times.rb (use RichUnits instead)
    * deprecated uploadutils.rb; ziputils.rb will be (use Folio)
    * deprecated annotations.rb (use Anise instead)
    * deprecated command.rb and consoleutils.rb (use Clio instead)

* 5 Minor Changes

    * deprecated chain.rb (very expiremental)
    * deprecated eventhook.rb (moved to ToadCode project)
    * deprecated tagiter.rb (moved to ToadCode project)
    * moved Hash#symolize_keys and #stringify_keys to core lib
      (still recommend #rekey instead though)
    * switched to git as of 2.4.5

* 4 Bug Fixes

    * memoize.rb, cache was at class-level, now at instance-level
    * binding/caller.rb, fixed require for callstack.rb
    * fixed missing require in string/tabto.rb
    * Fixed some bugs with Time#ago/Time#hence not changing years
      correctly when you changed months.
      (For example, Time.utc(2008, 1, 1).ago(12, :months) incorrectly
      returned 2009-01-01 instead of 2007-01-01.)
      Changed Time#ago/Time#hence to still work if passed negative number.


== 2.4.5 / 2008-10-02

Facets 2.4.5 is a maintaince release. This release is notable
however in that it will likely be the last that to use SVN.
Facets will be switching to Git. Also, some libraries that

finally be so.

2008-06-11  tylerrick

        * Made FileUtils#whereis a module_function again like it used to be. Because:
          (1) that seems to be the way most other FileUtils methods are (cd, mkdir, cp, ...) and the most obvious way that users would WANT to use FileUtils: FileUtils.whereis("ruby"). 
          (3) I see module_function used in other comparible parts of Facets: UploadUtils, ConsoleUtils, ZipUtils, FileUtils#safe_ln, ...
          (3) My code that relied on the old module_function behavior was breaking
          What were you thinkin changing it?? ;)




== 2.4.1 / 2008-04-03

* 5 Changes

    * Comparing to ActiveSupport, found 63 extension clashes, but most are due to 1.9 features and the rest should be compatible.
    * A much improved paramix.rb has been returned to the library; but please note it's not quite finished yet.
    * Reatomized a number of Kernel and String methods. Reatomization is nearly complete.
    * Deprecated behavior.rb. It was not robust.
    * Added basex.rb, library for working in any encoding base using any character set (base62 is the default).


        * Paramix is all spiffy again.
          * There a no longer capitialize module methods at all.
          * Use Module#[] and mixin_params[] instead.

== 2.4.0 / 2008-03-24

    * String#to_re and String#to_rx have swapped default behaviors. #to_rx escapes, #to_re does not.
    * The Console namespace is being deprecated. command.rb and arguments.rb now use CLI naemspace.
    * #compare_on and #equate_on are now "mixin methods" Comparable() and Equateable().
    * Enumerable#product, #combintations and #permutations have change to be Ruby 1.9 compatible.
    * thread.rb, map_send, et al, block is passed to send instead of yielding on result.
    * namespace.rb has been renamed to methodspace.rb.
    * Ruby 1.9 defined a new Proc#curry method, so Facets version has been made compatible.
    * The old curry method is now called #partial, as in "partial application".
    * Deprecated interface.rb. Perhaps a better approach but nonetheless extraneous.
    * Deprecated paramix.rb. A better way is to use a capitialized methods. (Perhaps a lib for that?)
    * Brought back a few web related libs, htmlfilter.rb and cssfilter.rb in particular.
    * camelcase and snakecase are core extensions. For specialized styles use String#style in style.rb.
    * This was a fairly large and fast-paced update, so unfortunately not all changes are listed this time.

    * openobject.rb (added NilClass#to_openobject) [update]
    * enumerable/each_slice.rb [replace]
      Ruby already has #each_slice if you require 'enumerator'. And for 1.9,
      I believe, this will be present automatically. So Facets' each_slice
      has been replaced with a simple redirection to require 'enumerator'.
      Ruby's version is slightly different in that it won't check arity if
      a slice count is not given. For this, use enumerable/each_by.
    * array/delete_at.rb [removed]
      Ruby's Array class already has a #delete_at method,
      although this is another method at odds with Hash.
      Use #delete_values_at instead.

    * move ProjectInfo to proj/info
    * better arrangment of repository
    * Added nil#status, module#alias_method_chain and enumerable#cascade.
    nil#status - Allows a messgae to be passed through a failure chain.
    module#alias_method_chain - from rails this is clever idiom for
    module-based method wrapping. A limited solution, but since
    there's no standard solution as of yet, well support til then.
    enumerable#cascade - cascade a list of action on each element
    of an enumerable.
    * method missing in htmlbuilder effected by basic object fix
    * minor update to functor.rb
    * change WebAgent to Web
    * Removed hash/keys_to_iv b/c it is a poor name. Since the alternative of
      keys_to_instance_variables conveys the wrong idea, decided to just get
      rid of this. Instead use the Rails compatibile hash/variablize_keys.
    * 1.4RC3
    * initial import


== 1.4.4 / 2007-07-03

    * added nil#status - Allows a messgae to be passed through
      a failure chain.
    * added module#alias_method_chain - from rails this is clever
      idiom for module-based method wrapping. A limited
      solution, but since there's no standard solution as
      of yet, well support til then.
    * added enumerable#cascade - cascade a list of actions on each
      element of an enumerable. Better name for this?
    * method missing in htmlbuilder effected by BasicObject fix
      (use __self__.method instead of __metod__)
    * minor update to functor.rb. Added @self = function.binding.self.
      Still tweaking for best meta informatin access.
    * change WebAgent to Web
    * Removed hash/keys_to_iv b/c it is a poor name. Since the alternative
      of #keys_to_instance_variables conveys the wrong idea, decided to just
      get rid of this. Instead use the hash#variablize_keys which is also
      Rails compatibile.


== 1.4.2 / 2006-06-21

    * Started using Darcs --finally!
    * Transition to Darcs has interupted ChangeLog though :(
    * Mostly minor fixes in prepeartion for official 1.4 release.
    * Adjusted BasicObject slightly, further reducing unhidden methods.
      Among them __object__, __method__ and #as. Also added method_missing
      that detects shadow methods and rebinds them to Object. Keep in mind
      that woun't help you if you override method_missing which is
      typical for this class.
    * Fixed bug in BasicObject#__self__.


== 1.4.0 / 2006-06-05

    * Added Cookie, HTTP and HTTPAccess of ...'s library.
    * OpenObject's __get__ and __set__ methods have been changed
      to __fetch__ and __store__ to correspond to the Hash methods.
    * Added OpenCascade, which is like OpenObject but chains access.
    * Added ...'s lazy.rb which include's Future and Promise classes.
    * Added task.rb, which provides a Rake interface compatible task
      system, but that can be used in any code.
    * Improved Hash#traverse (it now does all traversing before yielding).
    * kernel/me, kernel/methodname and kernel/method_name have all been
      deprecated in favor of the 1.9 standard kernel/__method__ and
      kernel/__callee__.
    * Console::Application is deprecated and is no longer an alias for
      Console::Command.
    * Console::Command also now supports run-on flags (eg. -xvzf).
    * More's classinherit.rb has been removed, and classmethods.rb will be
      too in  another version or two. You should transition all uses of
      these to core/module/class_extension.rb.
    * Updated tuple.rb so that when a string is converted to a Tuple (#to_t)
      the values wll be made integers if they are composed of only numbers.
      If you need all strings you can use a block since the block bypasses
      this auto coercement, eg. to_t{ |v| v }.


== 1.3.1 / 2006-04-17

    * Deprecated string/to_arr, and slightly adjusted string#to_a.
      (Not commonly used so not a major change.)

    * Added zimba.tm's string/modulize, pathize and methodize.
    * Added some Gem methods, self/active?, self/gemspec, self/gempath.


== 1.0.3 / 2006-02-10

    * A last ditch attempt to keep facets and calibre as one project.
    * Added _why's Array modulo.


== 1.0.0 / 2005-12-04

    * Sped up string#similarity.
    * By popular protest deprecated usage of "AClass.use Facets, :amethod".
    * Created nicer layout of facets/support, /group, /english (one day /method).
    * Odd sets of facets have been move to facets/group/, eg. facets/group/inflect.
    * All is now well preped for a Rolls release shoud that come about.


== 0.10.30  Halloween

    * Change OrderedHash (ohash.rb) to Dictionary (dictionary.rb).
    * Change BlankSlate (blankslate.rb) to BasicObject (basicobject.rb).
    * Old versions of the above should still work, but throw warnings
      and will stop working come next version.
    * 1.rb has been renamed to one.rb (I know, two more characters,
      but you can do it! ;)
    * Methods enumerable/op_mod (%) and enumerable/eF are deprecated.
      Use #every or #ew instead.


== 0.10.11  Palapable

    * Merged Mega into Facets. I put the old Mega ChangeLog at
      the bottom of this document.
    * This represents the One-Point-Oh realease (albeit RC1) of
      Facets, but from now on I'll be using date versioning
      --if you look at the versions below you may understand why.
      The versioning sequence has no real rationality.
      Instead I will use this simple Rational Versioning Policy:
      * If YYYY-MM-DD it's a development release.
      * If YYYY-MM it's an official release.
      * If just YYYY it's hella stable.
      One might argue this is not as robust as a compatability
      significant point-based versioning system, but I'd say that's
      all well and good in theory, now give me something that actually
      works in practice.


== 0.9.5  Rebirth

    * Rebirth of Facets! As cool as the name Nano is, it became clear
      that most people are drawn toward the name Facets. So we are
      reverting back. Nonetheless Nano will remain a viable alias for
      Facets.
    * Must now use <code>require 'facets'</code> prior to using
      other Facets. This does two things. First it loads the
      base methods, which ensures that all programs have them
      readibly available when using Facets. Secondly it supplements
      #require to handle aliases. In essence, require 'facet/...',
      require 'facets/...' and require 'nano/...' all point to the
      same place(s). (NOTE This is a precursor to a more universal
      system that will handle aliasing automatically.)
    * kernel/require_esc has been removed. #require_nano will be also
      in the next release. These will no longer be needed thanks to
      the aliasing system.


== 0.9.2  Littles

    * Added string/starts_with? and string/ends_with?
    * Fixed module/memoize to cache on a per class/module bases.
    * Added module/is as an alias for /include.
    * Added module/shadow_method and shadow_all.
    * Renamed module/superup (which was module/supers) to module/as. And defined a new
      method called /superior which is like /super but skips to a sepecified ancestor.
    * Renamed module/super_send to module/send_as.


== 0.9.1  Wraps

    * Added module/nesting (not to be confused with the class method Module::nesting).
    * Thanks goes to Gavien Kistner for new string/word_wrap methods
      (with additioanl thanks to Dyane Borderson for his suggestions).
    * Added hash/each_with_key and each_with_index, as well as array/each_with_key;
      increasing polymorphism between the two classes.
    * Moved array/each_pair to enumerable/each_pair and changed how it worked to
      what one might expect.


== 0.9.0 / 2005-10-28 - NotUorI

    * Deprecated object#special_class, which was a method for (class<<self;self;end).
      Already have too many aliases for this, and though the name is fitting, the simpler
      method #own is better (alternative: #singleton).
    * Fixed enumerable/uniq_by file which was misnamed 'unique_by.rb'.
    * BIG CHANGE! Got rid of URI encoding on file names and sub'd a converson table
      of english readable names. Thanks Jeff Wood, Florain Gross, Dav Burt,
      Gavin Kistner, James Edward Gray II, Brian Schröder, Mauricio Fernández,
      David A. Black, Gavin Sinclair, Nikolai Weibull and Christian Neukirchen.


== 0.8.3  UorI

    * Added kernel/uri and kernel/unuri
    * (Good idea?) removed methods module/sattr, sattr_reader, &c. Instead created object/meta
      in which attr, attr_reader, &c. are made public. So, sattr -> meta.attr.
    * Added array/unzip
    * Added logger/format and logger/format_message (stub).
    * Added string/dequote.
    * Class method file names now begin with '::' to separate them from instance methods.


== 0.8.2  Nano Revolution

    * Name Change! What was Ruby Facets is now Nano Methods!
    * New minor version as there has been a change of plans with the integration of what was Carats.
      The classes and modules have been reseperated into their own project called Mega Modules.
    * Modified the #firstxxx/#lastxxx methods to be more congruent and comprehensible.
    * Renamed object/supers to object/superup. Better!
    * Got rid ot symbol/gen. Use object/generate_method_name or  module#generate_instance_method_name
      instead ( Is that the longest non-foo method name ever? :)
    * The file 1st.rb has moved to object/method. This modifies #method to persist the returned
      Method object. The original non-persitent version of #method is aliased to #original_method.
      (This arrangement is not set in stone though, and is still be considered.)
    * Added module/clone_using, module/clone_ranaming and module/clone_removing.
    * Added module/integrate (I love this one!)
    * Added many new enumerable methods: #filter_map, #compact_map, #commonality, #frequency,
      #probability and #find_collisions.
    * Moved some methods from array to enumerable: #each_permutation, #each_combination,
      #each_unique_pair and the class method ::combinations.
    * Added string/bytes per ruby-dev summary 26385-26467.
    * Moved #cattr_reader, #cattr_writer and #cattr_accessor from Class to Module.
    * Renamed numeric/octet_units to numeric/bytes_to_s and added a #bits_to_s as well.
    * Added class/descendants (alias subclasses) and class/remove_descendents, as well as
      object/descendents_of and object/remove_descendents_of.
    * Added methods to comparable: #cap, #clip. There are also #at_least and
      #at_most, although FYI #cap and #clip handle the same functionality.
    * Removed string/table_name and string/class_name (they were too Rails specific).
      Note: A new module has been added to Mega Modules, called orm-inflect.rb. It contains numerous
      methods for doing this sort of thing.
    * Added numeric/ceil_multiple (not sure about name though, perhaps a better name like "ceil_to"?).
    * Added string/soundex for calculating the soundex code of a word/name.
    * Added io/expect. I thought Ruby already had this but can't find it, so here it is for now.
    * Placed Florian's binding-of-caller.rb in binding/of_caller. Makes more sense there.
    * Fixed bug with Continuation::create (it wasn't defined as a class method and should have been).
    * Fixed bug with string/capitalized? which wasn't always giving the correct result.


== 0.7.2 / 2005-05-22 - George II

    * Added a class method dir/recurse which allows one to loop through a dir and all its
      subdirs, etc. It also has an alias #ls_r. Thanks goes to George Maschovitis for this.
    * Changed array/permute to array/each_permutation.


== 0.7.1  Quick George

    * Added facet.rb, although expiremental it makes it possible to use atomic methods without
      specificaly requiring them. It uses Object#method_missing to require them as needed.
    * Improved on "molecules", i.e. files that require numerous related atoms in a single go.
      These will see a great deal of continued improvement in the future.


== 0.7.0  Georgian Transform

    * All methods with names containing non-alphanumeric characters now have facet
      files without those special characters. This removes some incompatibilites with
      certain systems (including Windows). All such symbols have been replaced with
      CGI escape sequences, for instance 'in?.rb' becomes 'in%3F.rb'. To avoid having
      to use these "ugly" names, a new method has been added, kernel/require_facet.
    * Methods that were grouped together in the same file have been separated
      into their own files. Pure Atomicity has been achieved!
    * The method array/put has been dropped in favor of array/top (as a better alias for #unshift).
    * Methods #matchdata/post_match_from and #matchdata/pre_match_from have deprecated
      in favor of more generalized methods that serves the same purposes,
      matchdata/matchtree and matchdata/matchset.
    * Added module/include_as.
    * Added array/permute.


== 0.6.3  Gemstone

    * Gem is now avaliable!
    * Added kernel/require_all which allows one to require a pattern of files,
      making it easy to require every file in a directory.
    * Added hash/traverse and hash/traverse!, which takes a block and iterates over
      each key-value pair descending into subhash values and applying the block.
      (Thanks goes to Ara T. Howard and robert for their help.)
    * Added hash/collect. This uses enumerable/graph so that
      hash/collect will return a hash rather then an array.
    * Added numeric/before and numeric/after in place of #ago and #since
      and aliased #ago and #since to them, per the suggestions of
      Francis Hwang.
    * Added "poor man's profiler", time/elapse. (Thanks goes to Hal Fulton).
    * Changed enumerable/build_hash to enumerable/graph. The method #build_hash
      has been aliased to #graph for the time being for backward compatability.
    * Added array/last_index. (Thanks goes to Jabari)


== 0.6.2  Refinement I

    * Added kernel/resc as a shortcut for Regexp.escape.
    * Renamed hash/keys_to_string to hash/key_to_s and
      hash/keys_to_symbol to hash/keys_to_sym to be more consistant
      with other methods and what these methods specifically do.
      The old names have been deprecated.
    * Added hash/has_keys?, which allows for checking mutliple keys at once.
      Also includes #has_only_keys?
    * Added Rail's Time and Byte modules for Numeric with
      numeric/times.rb and numeric/bytes.rb (I've been informed that
      thanks go to Richard Kilmer for this. Thanks!)
    * Added numeric/octet_unit which utilizes numeric/bytes.
      (The name of this method may change in the future though.)
    * Added enumerable/uniq_by.
    * Added module/abstract.
    * Added module/redirect which is similar to alias, but does not
      copy the method, but rather wraps it. It also takes a hash so
      multiple methods can be redirected all at once.
    * Added string/shatter which is similar to split but includes
      the matched portions of text.

== 0.6.1  Florian's Mixes

    * Updated the current set of mix files which were still from
      version 0.5.0. (2004-12-31)


== 0.6.0  Florian's Onslaught

    * Major revisions made by Florian's onslaught. (2004-12-28)
    * First general public release.


== 0.5.0  Fit for First

    * This is the beginning of offical releases. (2004-12-23)
    * Now called Facets.
    * Changed layout to be completely atomic! (2004-10-30)


== 0.4.0  Raspberry

    * Scoured the Ruby world for useful additions.
    * Changed name again from A.B.C. to Raspberry.
      I can't seem to settle on a name. Even the new
      subsections have changed five times. (2004-08-08)
    * Adjusted Tuple to use Tuple::[*args] instead of ::new, which now takes
      a single argument instead, either an Array or a String which it splits.
    * Removed services.rb unitl in gets fixed and a better name.


== 0.3.3 Mega2

    * Added inheritable.rb, a lib for creating class vars inherit from ancestors
    * Addes annotations.rb, a lightweight metadata system good for annotating
      methods esspecially. It is built on top of inheritable.rb.


== 0.3.2 Mega

    * Added services.rb, a lib for managing methods as first class objects
    * Fixed/cleaned-up orm_supprt.rb


== 0.3.0  ABC

    * Reorganinzed all of this together in a nice neat way.
    * Changed name of library from Succ to A.B.C.
      which stands for All Base Common. (2004-02-02)
    * Name change to Mega Modules!
    * Added a few important files: multipliers.rb, binary_multipliers.rb,
      time_in_english.rb and orm_inlectors.rb.
    * Each one of these is a "Methods Module", i.e. They are a collection of
      closely related methods that modify one or more core classes/modules.
      Individually these methods could have very well ended up in Nano Methods,
      but given there quantity and interrelation they were more suitable to a
      module, and thus placed here.


== 0.3.1

    * Aliased #autoload_classes with #autorequire.
    * Added #strfbits and #strfbytes to binary_multiplers.rb.


== 0.2.0  Succ

    * A number of new methods added.
    * Renamed it Succ for "successor". (2003-05-31)
    * Initial public release


== 0.1.0  Carats

    * Early Development as Ruby Carats


== 0.0.0  TomsLib

    * Tomslib's just a few useful methods. (2002-07-01)
