- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  body: In block form, yields the last number of ((<b>lines</b>)) of file ((<b>filename</b>)). In non-block form, it returns the lines as an array.
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  body: Note that this method slurps the entire file, so I don't recommend it for very large files. If you want an advanced form of ((<b>tail</b>)), I suggest using file-tail, by Florian Frank (available on the RAA). And no tail -f.
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  # Returns last 3 lines of 'myfile'\n  FileUtils.tail(&quot;myfile&quot;,3)\n"
full_name: FileUtils#tail
is_singleton: false
name: tail
params: (filename,lines=10)
