As programmers are wont to do, I started collecting reusable pieces of
Ruby long ago. At first it was just a small function here, a useful
module there. Eventually the collection became sizable and I called it <i>TomsLib</i>.
As time wore on and my library grew, I started to feel it worth a general
release and I had renamed it <i>Raspberry Lib</i>. But sometime shortly thereafter
I hit upon the idea of <i>atomicity</i>of the core extensions. And that's how the 
name Facets came about -- it's all about the little things. Of course, that name
took a while to decide upon too. The library was almost called "Atomix &amp; Trix"!

Facets has eveolved considerably over the years --and lessons were learned. Probably
the biggest lesson was the 2.0 release, where the idea of atomicity was eroded and
and alternate means of library requiring was attempted. Both were rectified by 2.4.

Much has changed since those first days. But time has been good to Facets.
Today, Facets is a more solid and leaner library than ever before and will 
continue in the fashion for version to come.
