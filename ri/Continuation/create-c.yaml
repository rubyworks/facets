  text: Continuation Extension
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  body: Creates a continuation in a way that is easier to use than callcc. On the initial call this will return the created Continuation and the arguments you gave to Continuation.create in an Array. If you then issue .call() on the Continuation execution will jump back to the point of time where you initially invoked Continuation.create, but this time it will return the Continuation and the arguments you supplied in an Array.
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  body: You can supply a block instead of default arguments which will cause that block to be executed once and its result to be returned along side the created Continuation, but this form is confusing and does only rarely make sense.
