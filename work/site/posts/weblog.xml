    <h1>All About Facets</h1>
    Facets was forged from need, but hewed with blood, sweat and tears.
    Okay, blood? Maybe not so much :)

    <h1>On Version 2.4</h1>

    <p>Facets 2.4 developed out the lessons learned from earlier versions. The most important
    lesson being that Facets touted "atomicity" isn't neccessarily beneficial. Facets
    Core remains an <span class="red"><i>Atomic Library</i></span> becuase all methods are
    organized into individual files, such that nearly each can be required independently of
    any other. However atomicity can give a false sens of security. When cherry picking methods,
    one must keep in mind another programmer might pick a different set of methods. So ensured
    interoperbility depends on expecting an Facets method may be required. Nonetheless,
    atomicity still allows for highly granular control over loaded features --useful to minimize
    resource footprint.</p>

    <h1>On Version 2.0</h1>

    <p>Facets 2.x serious is a much leaner library than the 1.x series. Where 1.x focused on
    gathering large swaths of new functionally, 2.x is focusing on refinement. Along with this
    came a new "definition" of what it is to be "MORE". MORE is the equivalent of Ruby's Standard
    library. As such, only libraries one might reasonably conceive as part of Ruby's Standard lib
    are included. This led to a number of libraries being moved to their own projects.
    In particular, some web-related libraries were moved to <a href="http://blow.rubyforge.org">Blow</a>,
    the Units system to <a href="http://stick.rubyforge.org">Stick</a>, and the inflection system to
    <a href="http://english.rubyforge.org">English</a>. There were also a few libs removed simply
    because they weren't stable and/or useful enough.</p>

    <h1>How Facets Was Born</h1>

    <p>As programmers are wont to do, I started collecting reusable pieces of
    Ruby long ago. At first it was just a small function here, a useful
    module there. Eventually the collection became sizable and I called it <i>TomsLib</i>.
    As time wore on and my library grew, I started to feel it worth a general
    release and I had renamed it <i>Raspberry Lib</i>. But sometime shortly thereafter
    I hit upon the idea of <i>atomicity</i>of the core extensions. And that's how the 
    name Facets came about -- it's all about the little things. Of course, that name
    took a while to decide upon too. The library was almost called "Atomix &amp; Trix"!<p>

    <p>Facets has eveolved considerably over the years --and lessons were learned. Probably
    the biggest lesson was the 2.0 release, where the idea of atomicity was eroded and
    and alternate means of library requiring was attempted. Both were rectified by 2.4.</p>

    <p>Much has changed since those first days. But time has been good to Facets.
    Today, Facets is a more solid and leaner library than ever before and will 
    continue in the fashion for version to come.</p>
