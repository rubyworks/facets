= Facets Release History

== 2.9.0 / 2010-09-01

This release is fairly extensive as it was originally intended to be v3.0.
After further consideration it was decided to reserve v3.0 for the
polish of real world feedback and more progressive changes. The primary
focus of this release has been the completion of migrating Facets into a true
extensions library. With this release almost all add-on classes and mixins
have now been spun-off to other projects. Only the most general purposes
add-on classes and mixins remain.

A new TOUR library division has also been added to complement CORE and MORE.
This division houses purely optional extensions. The new division serves
a couple of useful purposes. In particular, it helps separates the standard
library extensions from optional core extension in the RDocs and thus makes
the perfect place to vet new extension ideas.

One important change that will effect anyone using Facets along side
ActiveSupport is that Facets no longer tries to conditionally avoid
method overlaps with ActiveSupport. This is fine for the upcoming
ActiveSupport 3.0 library which extends core classes directly instead of
using mixins. One need only require 'facets' in the Rails config/preinitializer.rb
file and ActiveSupport will take precedence over Facets. For older versions
of ActiveSupport, the best approach is to cherry pick from Facets just the
extensions you want, thus avoiding any conflicts. There are actually only a
dozen or so overlaps and all are intended to compatible, but it doesn't hurt
to be sure.

Lastly, it is worth mentioning that this release has been more thuroughly
tested than any version of Facets to date. Thanks to RVM this release runs
green on Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.

== 2.8.3 / 2010-04-10

New release which makes a few adjustments in Kernel core extensions,
adds a few new extensions and additions, plus other small improvements.
The biggest change is the addition of Recusor, which is created via
Enumerable#recursive. This class is somewhat like Enumerator and
provides a number of recursive methods.

Changes:

* 9 New Core Extensions

  * Enumerable#recursive provides a number of other recursive methods.
  * Enumerable#visit can be used to recursively iterate any Enumerable.
  * Module#set has been added (from Sinatra).
  * Symbol#/ is added to be like String#/.
  * Struct#to_h is added and will ultimately replace Struct#attributes.
  * ObjectSpace#reflect routes method calls to Kernel context.
  * Hash#to_module converts a hash to mixin module (Jay Fields).
  * Kernel#dup! is same as #try_dup from extlib.
  * Add File#ext which is a useful variation of #extname (Lavir the Whiolet).

* 3 Core Extensions Renamed

  * Renamed #set_from to #assign_from (alias remains until Kernel#set is considerd).
  * Renamed #populate to #assign and improve.
  * Kernel#instance_vars is now Kernel#instance and also more useful.

* 1 Core Deprecation

  * Removed #instance_eval hack.

* 2 Core Bug Fixes

  * #map_with_index now uses #each_with_index.
  * #to_proc_with_response spelling correction.

* 1 Core Adjustment

  * Aliased #metadef to #meta_def.

* 3 New More Libraries

  * casting_hash.rb provides CastingHash class, a hash with flexible keys and values.
  * prepend.rb allows for AOP-like inclusion of modules.
  * roman.rb provides simple roman numeral extensions to String and Integer.

* 5 More Improvements

  * Pathname#visit for iterating all entries beneath a path (chikamichi).
  * Pathname#to_str, b/c Pathname is basically a type of String (from extlib).
  * Range#at_rand in random.rb handles Float ranges (Lavir the Whiolet).
  * FileUtils#cp_rx provides controlled copies.
  * Stash class in stash.rb is improved and is now available as a stand-alone library.
  * ioredirect.rb has been removed as IORedirect no longer worked.
  * plugin_manager.rb has been removed. Use 'plugin' gem instead.


== 2.8.2 / 2010-02-22

This release fixes a bug by removing Numeric#size. Turns out that was a
core method already. It includes an "auditing" of the core enumerable
method which has led to a few modifications most noteable amoung them
renaming #map_detect to #find_yield and #compact_map to #purge.

Changes:

* 7 New Core Extensions

  * Add Enumerable#each_with_object.
  * Add #collapse which is a shortcut for flatten.compact.
  * Add Numeric#spacing (Mr. Groff)
  * Add Array#uniq_by! to complement Enumerable#uniq_by.
  * Add String#exclude? as opposite of #include?
  * Add Enumerable#exclude? as opposite of #include?
  * Add Proc#bind_to 

* 2 Extensions Renamed

  * Rename Enumerable#compact_map to #purge.
  * Rename Enumerable#map_detect to #find_yield.

* 4 Deprecations

  * Deprecate #inject!/#injecting in favor of #filter.
  * Deprecate Array#** as alias of #product.
  * Remove Numeric#size, as it was already used by core.
  * Spun tracepoint.rb off as a seprate library.

* 3 Other Changes

  * Integer#multiple? handles zero as an argument.
  * facets.rb is now dynamically loaded instead of code generated.
  * General imporvements to date.rb.


== 2.8.1 / 2009-12-25

This release simply fixes a few minor issues.

Changes:

* 1 New Standard Extension

  * Added Pathname#glob_relative to pathanme.rb.

* 3 Adjustments

  * Loading string/tab.rb no longer loads margin.rb or expand_tab.rb.
  * Fixed FileList method delegations.
  * Numeric#length and #size return +self+, not +to_s.length+.


== 2.8.0 / 2009-11-05

Facets 2.8 effectively completes the MORE library clean-up which peaked
with the previous 2.7 release. Another eight libraries have been deprecated,
a few of them spun-off to a separate project. However, this verison also
reverts a few of the deprecations made in the last version. These libs 
will remain in Facets's MORE library for the forseeable future.

This version effectively concludes the MORE library clean-up. The next, and
last version before Facets 3.0, will focus on "auditing" the CORE library.

Changes:

* 6 Libraries "Undeprecated":

  * ini.rb
  * linkedlist.rb
  * matcher.rb
  * memoizer.rb
  * roman.rb
  * semaphore.rb

* 5 Libraries Deprecated:

  * fileable.rb    (too esoteric)
  * ioredirect.rb  (needs better implementation)
  * coroutine.rb   (because of Fiber)
  * capsule.rb     (may be spun-off)
  * recorder.rb    (may be spun-off)

* 3 Libraries Spun-Off and Deprecated:

  * ansicode.rb           ansi
  * progressbar.rb        ansi
  * logger.rb             ansi

* Additonal Enhancements:

  * Kernel#extend can now take a block
  * Fixed kernel#d so it is useable
  * Added Range#at_rand (thanks to Tyler Rick)
  * Added Enumerable#map_detect (thanks to Scott Taylor)
  * String#/ calls File.join
  * Added String#newlines and String#cleanlines
  * String#titlecase includes apostrophe in words
  * BasicObject/BlankSlate is more compliant with 1.9.1 design
  * Enumerable#count can take multiple items, treats as logical Or
  * Class#class_extend extends class level, not class_eval
  * Integer#succ(n) becomes Fixnum#succ(n), succ.rb
  * Complete rewrite of Inheritor
  * Shellwords extensions have been reworked
  * Added String#similarity
  * Added Levenshtein String#edit_distance method
  * And other minor improvements (some thanks to ccjr)


== 2.7.0 / 2009-08-01

Facets 2.7 is the biggest release of Facets since 2.4. Rather then trickle-release these
changes over the course of the 2.6.x series, I made the decision to let 2.7 have them
all at once. In so doing this release nearly completes the process of trimming down
the MORE library to its essentials. Over 40 high-level libraries have been spun-off
as separate gems and/or deprecated. No doubt this is a big change for Facets, and the
transition may be a bit bumpy over the short-term, but I am certain that in the long-run
everyone involved will be better served. To help, I have listed the effected libraries
and the alternate gems availble to take their place.

A few other changes have also been made in the release that may also effect your code.
In particular you should note that #class_extension has been renamed to #class_extend
(require 'facets/class_extend'). In addition we have added a few new core methods such
as Exception#raised? and Symbol#thrown?.

Changes:

* Spun-Off Projects

These libraries have been deprectated from Facets entirely, but are available
as separate gems (or soon will be).

* Spun-Off But Still Available

These libraries have been spun-off into stand-alone gems, but remain
available via Facets too. Ultimately some of these will be removed
from Facets too (in particular the ansi libraries).

* Deprecations Without Current Replacement

The libraries have been deprecated but do not yet have replacements.
Seperate gems for these are planned though.

    * bbcode.rb
    * ini.rb
    * settings.rb
    * xmlhash.rb

* Deprecations Merged Into CORE

These libraries have been deprecated because their functionality was merged into
the CORE library and/or made available in some another way.

    * 1stclassmethod.rb   #method! and #instance_method! are now part of CORE.
    * elementor.rb        #per has been added to CORE.
    * elementwise.rb      #ewise has been added to CORE.
    * consoleutils.rb     #ask is in CORE, for the rest see Ansi or Clio project.
    * attr.rb             Added Module#attr_setter to CORE, and separated the rest in MORE.

* General Deprecations

These libraries have simply been deprecated because they were found lacking in
some significant fashion.

    * nilstatus.rb        Poved rather useless, not to mention trivial.
    * heap.rb             Heap was just an alias for PQueue anyway. Use 'pqueue' instead.
    * dependency.rb       Other solutions exist that are much better (like Advisable).
    * classmethods.rb     #class_extend solution is more robust.
    * ziputils.rb         Have a look at Folio (gem install folio) for replacement.
    * unheritable.rb      Implementation is trivial and usefulness questionable.
    * instantise.rb       Replaced by instance_function.rb.

* Other Enhancements

    * Fixed Proc#curry to work with #define_method (Thanks to R.Potter)
    * Module#class_extension has been renamed to #class_extend (require 'facets/class_extend').
    * kernel#instance is no longer in core; now it is an extra monkey patch for #instance_eval.
    * Kernel#this has been removed. It is equivalent to 'method(__method__)'.
    * BlankSlate is now an alias for BasicObject, and will be deprecated in the future.
    * Kernel#method! and Module#instance_method! now use a global variable for their cache.
    * #object_state (old name was #state) has been added to core.


== 2.6.0 / 2009-07-03

Facets 2.6.0 removes htmlfilter.rb and cssfilter.rb due to licensing
incompatability. These scripts are now available as a separate package
called 'htmlfilter'. Also removed are a few MORE libs that were too
expiremental and/or not robust enough. Effectively this finishes up
the "spring cleaning" of the MORE lib mentioned a few releases back.

But it also marks a new start in trimming MORE down further. We have
decided to do this for three reasons 1) Some of the MORE libs would
be better served as separate projects. 2) Facets will become a tighter
library, primarily focused on extensions. And 3) all libraries involved
will become easier to maintain and thus more robust in the long run.

This release also fixes an important arity bug with the recently added
Module#extend method --one of the very few actual core overrides in Facets.

Changes:

* 7 Major Enhancements

    * Removed htmlfilter.rb due to licensing issues.
    * Also removed cssfilter.rb ('gem install htmlfilter' now)
    * Removed rwdelegator.rb, simply not a robust solution.
    * Removed buildable.rb, api is too confusing.
    * Removed meta.rb which was not very useful and too expiremental anyway.
    * Removed prototype.rb, which needs it's own project.

* 3 Minor Enhancements

    * Removed Kernel#__HERE__ as it simply cannot work.
      (Ruby 1.9.2 will offer #source_location for the same, btw)
    * Returned binding/opvars to core.
    * Added Integer#length as suggested by Victor H. Goff III.

* 1 Bug Fix

    * Fixed arity issue with Module#extend.


== 2.5.2 / 2009-04-07

Facets 2.5.2 is a simple maintentance release which fixed a few issues
in the new to_hash.rb library. This release also added String#lowercase
and String#uppercae.

Changes:

* 1 Major Enhancement

    * added string/uppercase and lowercase

* 1 Minor Enhancement

    * adjustments to to_hash.rb


== 2.5.1 / 2009-03-05

Facets 2.5.1 fixes a few bugs, makes some small but nice additions
and improves 1.9 compatibility.

The most important addition to make note of is Object#extend, which has
been overridden to allow a block parameter. This is one of only two or three
actual "monkey patches" in all of Facets. The block, when provided,
is used to create an annonymous module which then extends the reciever.
This is a "good practice" way to extend objects, rather than using class_eval
on the singleton class.

Special thanks to Erik Veenstra, Pit Capitan and especially Sandor Szücs
for their contributions to this release.

Changes:

* 7 Major Enhancements

    * added Hash#group_by_value (thanks to Erik Veenstra)
    * added String#file
    * added Hash#new_with (Pit Capitan)
    * added module/extend.rb, now can take a block.
    * added hook.rb
    * added to_h_auto
    * overhauled to_hash.rb, now has multiple methods

* 10 Bug Fixes

    * corrected ostruct.rb to test for frozen state on updates
    * fixed String#left_align
    * fixed conflict between test_name.rb and test_arguments.rb
    * fixed Enumreable#split when reciever is empty array
    * fixed coruption of reciever by Hash#collate (thanks to Tilo Sloboda)
    * fixed Array#to_h, h={} was not initialized
    * fixed test of Module#conflict according ruby19
    * fixed Hash#dearray_singluar_values
    * association.rb stores reference when using #new
    * changed Array#product to make it compatible to ruby 19, deleted block parameter

* 5 Minor Enhancements

    * split enumerable/collect into map_with_index and compact_map
    * improved Array#to_h for 1.9 using flatten(1)
    * Dictionary#replace can take regular Hash too
    * move test_to_hash.rb from more to core
    * Doc'd that UnboundMethod#name returns Symbol in 1.9, but String in 1.8


== 2.5.0 / 2008-11-23

Facets 2.5.0 is an important milestone in the development of Facets.

This release has been tested against Rails' ActiveSupport library.
As long as Facets is loaded after ActiveSupport, everything
should work fine. Of course, there's no counting for real world
trials, but all ActiveSupport testcases pass under this scenario.

Secondly, this release is the first of two (or three) down-scaling
releases intended to remove all the remaining "excess" from the
library. This is being done for a variety of reasons. Some scripts
are substantial enough to be one their own and have been spun-off
into separate largely compatible projects. In this release:

  If you were using...   Use this project instead...

    annotations.rb         Anise

    bytes.rb               RichUnits
    times.rb

    command.rb             Clio
    consoleutils.rb

A few others scripts have been deprecated, without an alternative
recourse, simply because they were too weak, such as  uploadutils.rb,
or highly experimental, such as chain.rb and eventhook.rb.

Although this release constitutes an over all slimming down of Facets,
two excellent new libraries have been added.

1) *ini.rb* by Jeena Paradies. While YAML is frequently used by
Rubyists for configuration files, a full-on serializer like YAML
is often overkill. INI files provide a lightweight solution
specifically geared for configuration.

2) *filter.rb* by Brian Candler offers lazy evaluation chains of
Enumerable methods. This is an elegant way to optimize contiguous
maps, selections, etc. --effective even on infinite enumerators.
(Note, the name of this library may be changed in the next release.)

While work remains to be done, I am happy to say, Facets is
finally beginning to approach the level of solidity I set out to
achieve just over a year ago. Thank the Maker!

Special thanks to Brian Candler, Jeena Paradies and Tyler Rick.

Changes:

* 9 Major Changes

    * added Brian Candler's Enumerator::Filter
    * added sparse_array.rb (was old harray.rb)
    * added Jeena Paradies' ini.rb
    * renamed CacheDelegator to Memoizer
    * renamed DictionaryMatcher to just Matcher
    * deprecated bytes.rb and times.rb (use RichUnits instead)
    * deprecated uploadutils.rb; ziputils.rb will be (use Folio)
    * deprecated annotations.rb (use Anise instead)
    * deprecated command.rb and consoleutils.rb (use Clio instead)

* 5 Minor Changes

    * deprecated chain.rb (very expiremental)
    * deprecated eventhook.rb (moved to ToadCode project)
    * deprecated tagiter.rb (moved to ToadCode project)
    * moved Hash#symolize_keys and #stringify_keys to core lib
      (still recommend #rekey instead though)
    * switched to git as of 2.4.5

* 4 Bug Fixes

    * memoize.rb, cache was at class-level, now at instance-level
    * binding/caller.rb, fixed require for callstack.rb
    * fixed missing require in string/tabto.rb
    * Fixed some bugs with Time#ago/Time#hence not changing years
      correctly when you changed months.
      (For example, Time.utc(2008, 1, 1).ago(12, :months) incorrectly
      returned 2009-01-01 instead of 2007-01-01.)
      Changed Time#ago/Time#hence to still work if passed negative number.


== 2.4.5 / 2008-10-02

Facets 2.4.5 is a maintaince release. This release is notable however in that
it will likely be the last that to use SVN. Facets will be switching to Git.
Also, some libraries that have been flagged "to be deprecated" for some time
will finally be so.

== 2.4.4 / 2008-09-01

Facets 2.4.4 includes a major bug fix that caused Facets not to load properly,

== 2.4.3 / 2008-08-14

Facets is almost fully interoperable with ActiveSupport and Ruby 1.9.
We will continue to improve this interoperability in upcoming releases.

As a REMINDER, Facets 2.4+ now encourages:

  require 'facets'

This is better than cherry-picking methods. It may seem counter-intuitive,
but it actually proves more advantages to do this for the sake of
improved interoperability. The practice of cherry-picking can become
problematic if other dependent libraries have cherry-picked different
methods. In those cases these distinctions go unaccounted and untested.

Note that this release does not include a setup.rb script. We are working
on a new version of this script, which we plan to include in the next release.

This release give special thanks to the following people for their contributions:

* Ken Bloom
* Nick Caruso
* Evgeniy Dolzhenko
* Andy Freeman
* Tomasz Muras
* Dave Myron

And of course, to anyone else I failed to mention that has contributed.

(NOTE: 2.4.3's changes may actually be long to 2.4.2. Notice the releases are
only two days apart. There was an issue with 2.4.2 and it had to be replaced
immediately. So take the distinct with a grain of salt.)

Changes:

* Additions

    * Add Time#trunc and Time#round to Core.
    * Add Array#recursively and fixed bug in Hash#recursively.
    * Add Kernel#instance method which provides a fluent interface to private object space.
    * Add Symbol#plain?, Symbol#query? and Symbol#setter?
    * Add Hash#symbolize_keys and #stringify_keys.
    * Add File#split_root.
    * Add #glob and #glob_first as extensions to Pathname.
    * Add NilClass#ergo whic points back to kernel/ergo.
    * Add #bump method to VersionNumber class.
    * Add String#mask providing powerful string manipulation.
    * Add Ken Bloom's DictionaryMatcher class (will be renamed in future version)

* Deprecations

    * Deprecate Hash#keys_to_s and Hash#keys_to_sym.
      * These are the original versions of these methods.
      * But now we can use #rekey(:to_s) and #rekey(:to_sym) instead.
    * Deprecat ruby.rb, which was a sort 1.9 compatibility layer.

* 22 Major Enhancements

    * Changed File#rewrite to not use the in-place change of the string.
    * Renamed Class#to_pathname and #to_methodname to #pathize and #methodize.
    * Removed Console:: namespace for ANSICode.
    * Moved Mentalguy's lazy.rb to core!
    * Added Indexable and Stackable to core.
    * BasicObject is now just a synonm for BlankSlate unless Ruby 1.9.  [major]
    * Moved Indexable and Stackable to core.
    * Renamed arguments.rb and CLI::Arguments to argvector.rb and Argvector.
    * Added optional argument to Dictionary#first and #last.
    * Moved binding/opvars from core to more.

* 19 Minor Enhancements

    * Improved File#rootname --it is now more robust.
    * Made FileUtils#whereis a module_function again.
    * Created Lore library to house extensions to Ruby's standard library.
    * Re-added facets class files (eg. facets/string) and are now dynamic.
    * Added block to Array#index.
      * This is one of the few core overrides in Facets.
      * It is a feature already in Ruby 1.9.
    * Added Jim Weirich's BlankSlate class.
      * This is a temporary measure be compatible w/ AcitveSupport's BasicObject.
    * Split kernel/load.rb into require_all.rb and require_local.rb.
    * Split module/alias.rb up into alias_accessor, alias_module_function and alias_method_chain.
    * Renamed string/subtract to string/op_sub.
      Old name will remain for time being for compatability. [minor]
    * Moved style.rb to string/stylize.rb  [minor]
    * Added warning to bytes to use RichUnits instead.
    * Updated warn line fore eventual deprecation of fileshell and arguments.*
    * Added facets-load.rb to allow old school cherry picking.*
      * Between 2.0 and 2.4 require 'facets' simply added core to LOAD_PATH.
      * Starting with 2.4 it loads all of core automatically instead.
      * facets-load.rb provides a way to use the old behavior.
            require 'facets-load.rb
            require 'kernel/with'
            require 'symbol/to_proc'
      * This adds the path to the end of LOAD_PATH to prevent any load conflicts.

* 5 Bug Fixes

    * Fixed Time#hence changed years when changing months.
    * Fixed Time#hence to flip year correctly when adding months.
    * Hash#<< returns self
    * Fixed String#pathize.
    * Module#instance_method_defined? now only applies to public methods.

* Administrative Enhancements

    * While not perceptible to an end user, there are now 3 divisions: lib/core, lib/lore, lib/more.
    * Modified script/test to display $LOAD_PATH before running tests.

== 2.4.2 / 2008-08-12

Just some more of those great old work your ass off changes.

Changes:

* Major Enhancements

    * Added Ken Bloom's DictionaryMatcher class from Ruby Quiz #103.
      (Note this class will probably be renamed in the future.)
    * Changed File#rewrite to not use the inplace change of the string.
      * If you were using the function, change your code to use File#rewrite! instead.
      * Or, modify your code ot use the new behavior.
      * This change can make for a slippery bug, so be sure to check for it!
    * Moved live.rb to facets-live.rb.
    * Added kernel/instance method which provides a fluent interface to private object space.

* 5 Minor Enhancements

    * Added sow generation forms.
    * Spilt Time#trunc into separate file.
    * Remove old log files --shouldn't version control these.
    * Added note to FileList to add glob options parameter.
    * Added optional argument to Dictionary#first and #last.

* Other Enhancements

    * Move "lore" tests to test/lore (lore are extensions to Ruby's standard lib).
    * Added test/core, test/lore and test/more.
    * Added time/test_round.rb
    * Added array/recursively.
    * Added time/round.
    * Time#to_date makes the public (it already existed in Ruby!)
    * Fixed Time#hence to flip year correctly when adding months.
    * Work on documentation using new Sow system.
    * Moved meta.rb to more/kernel/meta.rb and merged facets/core.rb into facets.rb.
    * Added more/kernel directory --hey not every extension can be core.
    * Adjusted loadpath and moved lazy.rb to core!
    * Moved remaing files to subdirectory locations.
    * Moved most core libs to core/.
    * Move most more files to the more directory.
    * Added lore and more directories.
    * Added facets/core directory. Yes, I'm spiliting the lib again.
      * Loadpath will be used, so user inteface will stay the same.
      * Setup.rb will be adjusted to recognaize loadpath.
    * Removed Rope class. If anything this will have a separate project.
    * Moved setup.rb to script/setup.
      * This will either be replaced with configure/install scripts.
      * Or, depend on a separate ruby setup.rb project.
    * Added recorder.rb to consider in work directory.
    * Added admin directory.
    * Added "TO BE DEPRECATED" message to ruby.rb.
    * Added all methods from ruby.rb as individual core methods.
      * These are the methods that overlap with 1.9.
      * They are encased in 'unless RUBY_VERSION' caluses.
    * Imporved file/rootname --now much more robust.
    * Added Kernel#to_yamlfrag to yaml.rb as way to output yaml w/o the "---" header.
      * Perhaps not the most robust solution, but okay for now.
      * Maybe a poor name for the method, but you got a better one?
    * Made FileUtils#whereis a module_function again like it used to be. Because:
      (1) that seems to be the way most other FileUtils methods are (cd, mkdir, cp, ...) and the most
          obvious way that users would WANT to use FileUtils: FileUtils.whereis("ruby").
      (2) I see module_function used in other comparible parts of Facets: UploadUtils, ConsoleUtils,
          ZipUtils, FileUtils#safe_ln, ...
      (3) My code that relied on the old module_function behavior was breaking
          What were you thinking changing it?? ;)


== 2.4.1 / 2008-04-03

This release takes aim at improving compatability with ActiveSupport.
It also reintroduces an improved paramix.rb.

Changes:

* 4 Major Enhancements

    * A much improved paramix.rb has been returned to the library.
      * There a no longer capitialize module methods at all.
      * Use Module#[] and mixin_params[] instead.
    * Deprecated behavior.rb. It was not robust.
    * Added basex.rb, for working in any encoding base using any character set (base62 is the default).

* 3 Minor Enhancements

    * Comparing to ActiveSupport, found 63 extension clashes, but most are due to 1.9 features.
      The rest should be compatible.
    * Reatomized a number of Kernel and String methods. Reatomization is nearly complete.
    * Continued work on reatomizing core extensions (nearly complete now).


== 2.4.0 / 2008-03-24

Facets 2.4 is a major step forward for Facets. It is perhaps the release
that 2.0 should have been, but of course it took the actual 2.0 release
to make 2.4 possible. Some annoyances you may have encountered in updating
your code to 2.0 are now fixed. And from 2.4 on, Facets will now be
settling down into simple refinement release cycles for a while.

The main change under the hood is to bring everything up to the top
lib/facets/ directory. No longer are the libraries sorted by category.
I had done so for a long time to make it easier to track the various libs,
but in the end it was only making it more diffcult to deal with build tools
and packaging.

For the end-user, the largest change is a new emphisis on:

  require 'facets'

This is better than cherry-picking methods. It may seem counter-
intuitive, but it actually proves more advantantages to do this
for the sake of interoperability than the practice of cherry-picking.
The reason is simply because others may have cherry-picked different
methods, and those distinctions go unaccounted and untested.

Also with this release, to bolster the use of require 'facets',
some lack-luster extensions have been deprecated and namespace usage
has been improved. In addition, we are getting very close to full
ActiveSupport, and Ruby 1.9, interoperability. Expect this
to be complete in the next minor release or two.

Changes:

* Enhancements

    * String#to_re and String#to_rx have swapped default behaviors. #to_rx escapes, #to_re does not.
    * The Console namespace is being deprecated. command.rb and arguments.rb now use CLI naemspace.
    * #compare_on and #equate_on are now "mixin methods" Comparable() and Equateable().
    * Enumerable#product, #combintations and #permutations have change to be Ruby 1.9 compatible.
    * thread.rb, map_send, et al, block is passed to send instead of yielding on result.
    * namespace.rb has been renamed to methodspace.rb.
    * Ruby 1.9 defined a new Proc#curry method, so Facets version has been made compatible.
    * The old curry method is now called #partial, as in "partial application".
    * Deprecated interface.rb. Perhaps a better approach but nonetheless extraneous.
    * Deprecated paramix.rb. A better way is to use a capitialized methods. (Perhaps a lib for that?)
    * Brought back a few web related libs, htmlfilter.rb and cssfilter.rb in particular.
    * camelcase and snakecase are core extensions. For specialized styles use String#style in style.rb.
    * Renamed ArgVector to CLI::Arguments
    * Moved one_nine.rb to ruby.rb
    * Moved test/test_one_nine.rb to test/test_ruby.rb.
    * Updated requires for "one_nine" to just "ruby" b/c of backports to 1.8.7.
    * Added warning to Rick Kilmers's unit system.
        * Moving Rich Kilmers's units system to it's own package.
        * Three are alternate unit systems available and Facets should work with any of them.
        * Will keep a fair amount of the Time extensions though.
    * Moved nil/status.rb to nilstatus.rb
    * Got rid of Method#curry and Method#partial since they just convert to Procs.
    * Made op_esc.rb a separate module rather thanan extension.
    * Deprecated with_reader, with_writer and with_accessor for attr_singleton_reader, &c.
    * Deprecated Hash#pairs_at. Use Hash#slice instead from core.
    * Fixed the namespaces of some extensions.
    * Added prime directory and files.
    * Removed all "prime" extension files.
    * Move mattr to module.
    * Fixed require bug in time methods.
    * Reverted memomize.rb back to original code --will come back to later.
    * Added stylizer.rb to replace stylize.rb
    * Array #recursively is not only called #traverse.
    * Added case/stylize methods to more/facets/string.
    * Renamed more/string/facets/titlecase to captialize_all.
    * Added uri and xoxo tests.
    * Progressive work on memoize and elementor.
    * Functor no longer privatizes =, == and =~.
    * Properly split conversion.rb.
    * Some string methods extracted from stylize.rb.
    * Moved random.rb to more/.
    * Renamed namespace.eb to methodspace.rb.
    * Moved autoreload to more/facets/kernel.
    * Removed old curry.rb.
    * Added cgi.rb with some standard extensions.
    * Deprecated paramix.rb.
    * Added xmlhash.rb and returned uri.rb extensions to the library.
    * Added #method_name to Date class.
    * Remove cut-bases AOP, now in it's own library.
    * Converted compare_on.rb to Paramtric Mixins.
    * Split fileutils up into individual methods.
    * Renamed console.rb to what it should be consoleutils.rb.
    * Update to command.rb integrating MasterCommand and Command into a single class.
    * Added options back into multiglob_r.
    * Improved cloneable.rb to be a true deep dup/clone mixin using Ken Bloom's suggestion.
    * Added tasksystem.rb.
    * Added enumerable/combinations.
    * Added openhash and tracepoint.

* Bug Fixes

    * Fixed bug with #peek in stackable.
    * Fixed bug in Kernel#object_hexid.
    * Fixed bug in multiglob_r so it will NOT follow symlinks.
    * Fixed test_keyize.rb.

* Adminstrative Changes

    * This was a fairly large and fast-paced update, so unfortunately not all changes are listed this time.
    * Added ri generation to setup.rb.
    * Updated README and allowed doc/ to be included in package.
    * Finally completed removal of all embedded tests.
    * Organized all libs between core, more, class and mixin.


== 2.3.0 / 2008-02-01

    * Divided enumerable/collect into split.rb and each.rb as well.
    * Moved mapsend.rb to thread.rb.
    * Updated mapsend.rb to focus on threads.

    * [update] annotation.rb, fixed :self key
    * [added] pathname/op_div

    * command.rb: minor change to docs [update]
    * openobject.rb (added NilClass#to_openobject) [update]
    * enumerable/each_slice.rb [replace]
      Ruby already has #each_slice if you require 'enumerator'. And for 1.9,
      I believe, this will be present automatically. So Facets' each_slice
      has been replaced with a simple redirection to require 'enumerator'.
      Ruby's version is slightly different in that it won't check arity if
      a slice count is not given. For this, use enumerable/each_by.
    * array/delete_at.rb [removed]
      Ruby's Array class already has a #delete_at method,
      although this is another method at odds with Hash.
      Use #delete_values_at instead.

    * fix instance_interception test
    * doc cleanup
    * added hash/op_div and array/op_div to BASE.
    * remove kernel/called and fixed callee,__callee__ and __method__.
    * just about prefected OpenObject
    * keys_to_sym to symbolize_keys usage
    * remove explore dir, perhaps better to do without midstage
    * added to_a to OpenObject
    * minor touchup to opencascade

    * Added deep_clone (thanks Jan Molic)
    * project metadata work adjustments

== 1.4.5 / 2006-07-05

Changes:

    * move ProjectInfo to proj/info
    * better arrangment of repository
    * Added nil#status, module#alias_method_chain and enumerable#cascade.
    nil#status - Allows a messgae to be passed through a failure chain.
    module#alias_method_chain - from rails this is clever idiom for
    module-based method wrapping. A limited solution, but since
    there's no standard solution as of yet, well support til then.
    enumerable#cascade - cascade a list of action on each element
    of an enumerable.
    * method missing in htmlbuilder effected by basic object fix
    * minor update to functor.rb
    * change WebAgent to Web
    * Removed hash/keys_to_iv b/c it is a poor name. Since the alternative of
      keys_to_instance_variables conveys the wrong idea, decided to just get
      rid of this. Instead use the Rails compatibile hash/variablize_keys.
    * 1.4RC3
    * initial import


== 1.4.4 / 2007-07-03

Changes:

    * added nil#status - Allows a messgae to be passed through
      a failure chain.
    * added module#alias_method_chain - from rails this is clever
      idiom for module-based method wrapping. A limited
      solution, but since there's no standard solution as
      of yet, well support til then.
    * added enumerable#cascade - cascade a list of actions on each
      element of an enumerable. Better name for this?
    * method missing in htmlbuilder effected by BasicObject fix
      (use __self__.method instead of __metod__)
    * minor update to functor.rb. Added @self = function.binding.self.
      Still tweaking for best meta informatin access.
    * change WebAgent to Web
    * Removed hash/keys_to_iv b/c it is a poor name. Since the alternative
      of #keys_to_instance_variables conveys the wrong idea, decided to just
      get rid of this. Instead use the hash#variablize_keys which is also
      Rails compatibile.


== 1.4.2 / 2006-06-21

Changes:

    * Started using Darcs --finally!
    * Transition to Darcs has interupted ChangeLog though :(
    * Mostly minor fixes in prepeartion for official 1.4 release.
    * Adjusted BasicObject slightly, further reducing unhidden methods.
      Among them __object__, __method__ and #as. Also added method_missing
      that detects shadow methods and rebinds them to Object. Keep in mind
      that woun't help you if you override method_missing which is
      typical for this class.
    * Fixed bug in BasicObject#__self__.


== 1.4.0 / 2006-06-05

Changes:

    * Added Cookie, HTTP and HTTPAccess of ...'s library.
    * OpenObject's __get__ and __set__ methods have been changed
      to __fetch__ and __store__ to correspond to the Hash methods.
    * Added OpenCascade, which is like OpenObject but chains access.
    * Added ...'s lazy.rb which include's Future and Promise classes.
    * Added task.rb, which provides a Rake interface compatible task
      system, but that can be used in any code.
    * Improved Hash#traverse (it now does all traversing before yielding).
    * kernel/me, kernel/methodname and kernel/method_name have all been
      deprecated in favor of the 1.9 standard kernel/__method__ and
      kernel/__callee__.
    * Console::Application is deprecated and is no longer an alias for
      Console::Command.
    * Console::Command also now supports run-on flags (eg. -xvzf).
    * More's classinherit.rb has been removed, and classmethods.rb will be
      too in  another version or two. You should transition all uses of
      these to core/module/class_extension.rb.
    * Updated tuple.rb so that when a string is converted to a Tuple (#to_t)
      the values wll be made integers if they are composed of only numbers.
      If you need all strings you can use a block since the block bypasses
      this auto coercement, eg. to_t{ |v| v }.


== 1.3.1 / 2006-04-17

Changes:

    * Deprecated string/to_arr, and slightly adjusted string#to_a.
      (Not commonly used so not a major change.)

Changes:

    * Ported parts of Nitro's Glue library to Facets.

      * core/enumerable/accumulate.rb
    * Added xoxo.rb, json.rb and rtals.rb.
    * Repaired missing data files for units.rb.
    * Moved cattr methods from module/ to class/.
    * mattr methods are in limbo at the moment.
      (They were aliases for cattr.)

Changes:

    * A last ditch attempt to keep facets and calibre as one project.
    * Added _why's Array modulo.


== 1.0.0 / 2005-12-04

Okay. Now we've finally hit our 1.0.0 relase. Yea! Does it desrve 1.0 at this point?
Ah, well close enough. Mainly there won't be anymore silly development names ;)

Changes:

    * Sped up string#similarity.
    * By popular protest deprecated usage of "AClass.use Facets, :amethod".
    * Created nicer layout of facets/support, /group, /english (one day /method).
    * Odd sets of facets have been move to facets/group/, eg. facets/group/inflect.
    * All is now well preped for a Rolls release shoud that come about.


== 0.10.30

Halloween

Changes:

    * Change OrderedHash (ohash.rb) to Dictionary (dictionary.rb).
    * Change BlankSlate (blankslate.rb) to BasicObject (basicobject.rb).
    * Old versions of the above should still work, but throw warnings
      and will stop working come next version.
    * 1.rb has been renamed to one.rb (I know, two more characters,
      but you can do it! ;)
    * Methods enumerable/op_mod (%) and enumerable/eF are deprecated.
      Use #every or #ew instead.


== 0.10.11

Palapable

Changes:

    * Merged Mega into Facets. I put the old Mega ChangeLog at
      the bottom of this document.
    * This represents the One-Point-Oh realease (albeit RC1) of
      Facets, but from now on I'll be using date versioning
      --if you look at the versions below you may understand why.
      The versioning sequence has no real rationality.
      Instead I will use this simple Rational Versioning Policy:
      * If YYYY-MM-DD it's a development release.
      * If YYYY-MM it's an official release.
      * If just YYYY it's hella stable.
      One might argue this is not as robust as a compatability
      significant point-based versioning system, but I'd say that's
      all well and good in theory, now give me something that actually
      works in practice.


== 0.9.5

Rebirth

Changes:

    * Rebirth of Facets! As cool as the name Nano is, it became clear
      that most people are drawn toward the name Facets. So we are
      reverting back. Nonetheless Nano will remain a viable alias for
      Facets.
    * Must now use <code>require 'facets'</code> prior to using
      other Facets. This does two things. First it loads the
      base methods, which ensures that all programs have them
      readibly available when using Facets. Secondly it supplements
      #require to handle aliases. In essence, require 'facet/...',
      require 'facets/...' and require 'nano/...' all point to the
      same place(s). (NOTE This is a precursor to a more universal
      system that will handle aliasing automatically.)
    * kernel/require_esc has been removed. #require_nano will be also
      in the next release. These will no longer be needed thanks to
      the aliasing system.


== 0.9.2

Littles

Changes:

    * Added string/starts_with? and string/ends_with?
    * Fixed module/memoize to cache on a per class/module bases.
    * Added module/is as an alias for /include.
    * Added module/shadow_method and shadow_all.
    * Renamed module/superup (which was module/supers) to module/as. And defined a new
      method called /superior which is like /super but skips to a sepecified ancestor.
    * Renamed module/super_send to module/send_as.


== 0.9.1

Wraps

Changes:

    * Added module/nesting (not to be confused with the class method Module::nesting).
    * Thanks goes to Gavien Kistner for new string/word_wrap methods
      (with additioanl thanks to Dyane Borderson for his suggestions).
    * Added hash/each_with_key and each_with_index, as well as array/each_with_key;
      increasing polymorphism between the two classes.
    * Moved array/each_pair to enumerable/each_pair and changed how it worked to
      what one might expect.


== 0.9.0 / 2005-10-28

NotUorI

Changes:

    * Deprecated object#special_class, which was a method for (class<<self;self;end).
      Already have too many aliases for this, and though the name is fitting, the simpler
      method #own is better (alternative: #singleton).
    * Fixed enumerable/uniq_by file which was misnamed 'unique_by.rb'.
    * BIG CHANGE! Got rid of URI encoding on file names and sub'd a converson table
      of english readable names. Thanks Jeff Wood, Florain Gross, Dav Burt,
      Gavin Kistner, James Edward Gray II, Brian Schröder, Mauricio Fernández,
      David A. Black, Gavin Sinclair, Nikolai Weibull and Christian Neukirchen.


== 0.8.3

Changes:

    * Added kernel/uri and kernel/unuri
    * (Good idea?) removed methods module/sattr, sattr_reader, &c. Instead created object/meta
      in which attr, attr_reader, &c. are made public. So, sattr -> meta.attr.
    * Added array/unzip
    * Added logger/format and logger/format_message (stub).
    * Added string/dequote.
    * Class method file names now begin with '::' to separate them from instance methods.


== 0.8.2

Nano Revolution

Changes:

    * Name Change! What was Ruby Facets is now Nano Methods!
    * New minor version as there has been a change of plans with the integration of what was Carats.
      The classes and modules have been reseperated into their own project called Mega Modules.
    * Modified the #firstxxx/#lastxxx methods to be more congruent and comprehensible.
    * Renamed object/supers to object/superup. Better!
    * Got rid ot symbol/gen. Use object/generate_method_name or  module#generate_instance_method_name
      instead ( Is that the longest non-foo method name ever? :)
    * The file 1st.rb has moved to object/method. This modifies #method to persist the returned
      Method object. The original non-persitent version of #method is aliased to #original_method.
      (This arrangement is not set in stone though, and is still be considered.)
    * Added module/clone_using, module/clone_ranaming and module/clone_removing.
    * Added module/integrate (I love this one!)
    * Added many new enumerable methods: #filter_map, #compact_map, #commonality, #frequency,
      #probability and #find_collisions.
    * Moved some methods from array to enumerable: #each_permutation, #each_combination,
      #each_unique_pair and the class method ::combinations.
    * Added string/bytes per ruby-dev summary 26385-26467.
    * Moved #cattr_reader, #cattr_writer and #cattr_accessor from Class to Module.
    * Renamed numeric/octet_units to numeric/bytes_to_s and added a #bits_to_s as well.
    * Added class/descendants (alias subclasses) and class/remove_descendents, as well as
      object/descendents_of and object/remove_descendents_of.
    * Added methods to comparable: #cap, #clip. There are also #at_least and
      #at_most, although FYI #cap and #clip handle the same functionality.
    * Removed string/table_name and string/class_name (they were too Rails specific).
      Note: A new module has been added to Mega Modules, called orm-inflect.rb. It contains numerous
      methods for doing this sort of thing.
    * Added numeric/ceil_multiple (not sure about name though, perhaps a better name like "ceil_to"?).
    * Added string/soundex for calculating the soundex code of a word/name.
    * Added io/expect. I thought Ruby already had this but can't find it, so here it is for now.
    * Placed Florian's binding-of-caller.rb in binding/of_caller. Makes more sense there.
    * Fixed bug with Continuation::create (it wasn't defined as a class method and should have been).
    * Fixed bug with string/capitalized? which wasn't always giving the correct result.


== 0.7.2 | 2005-05-22 | George II

Changes:

    * Added a class method dir/recurse which allows one to loop through a dir and all its
      subdirs, etc. It also has an alias #ls_r. Thanks goes to George Maschovitis for this.
    * Changed array/permute to array/each_permutation.


== 0.7.1 | Quick George

Changes:

    * Added facet.rb, although expiremental it makes it possible to use atomic methods without
      specificaly requiring them. It uses Object#method_missing to require them as needed.
    * Improved on "molecules", i.e. files that require numerous related atoms in a single go.
      These will see a great deal of continued improvement in the future.


== 0.7.0 | Georgian Transform

Changes:

    * All methods with names containing non-alphanumeric characters now have facet
      files without those special characters. This removes some incompatibilites with
      certain systems (including Windows). All such symbols have been replaced with
      CGI escape sequences, for instance 'in?.rb' becomes 'in%3F.rb'. To avoid having
      to use these "ugly" names, a new method has been added, kernel/require_facet.
    * Methods that were grouped together in the same file have been separated
      into their own files. Pure Atomicity has been achieved!
    * The method array/put has been dropped in favor of array/top (as a better alias for #unshift).
    * Methods #matchdata/post_match_from and #matchdata/pre_match_from have deprecated
      in favor of more generalized methods that serves the same purposes,
      matchdata/matchtree and matchdata/matchset.
    * Added module/include_as.
    * Added array/permute.


== 0.6.3 | Gemstone

Changes:

    * Gem is now avaliable!
    * Added kernel/require_all which allows one to require a pattern of files,
      making it easy to require every file in a directory.
    * Added hash/traverse and hash/traverse!, which takes a block and iterates over
      each key-value pair descending into subhash values and applying the block.
      (Thanks goes to Ara T. Howard and robert for their help.)
    * Added hash/collect. This uses enumerable/graph so that
      hash/collect will return a hash rather then an array.
    * Added numeric/before and numeric/after in place of #ago and #since
      and aliased #ago and #since to them, per the suggestions of
      Francis Hwang.
    * Added "poor man's profiler", time/elapse. (Thanks goes to Hal Fulton).
    * Changed enumerable/build_hash to enumerable/graph. The method #build_hash
      has been aliased to #graph for the time being for backward compatability.
    * Added array/last_index. (Thanks goes to Jabari)


== 0.6.2 | Refinement I

Changes:

    * Added kernel/resc as a shortcut for Regexp.escape.
    * Renamed hash/keys_to_string to hash/key_to_s and
      hash/keys_to_symbol to hash/keys_to_sym to be more consistant
      with other methods and what these methods specifically do.
      The old names have been deprecated.
    * Added hash/has_keys?, which allows for checking mutliple keys at once.
      Also includes #has_only_keys?
    * Added Rail's Time and Byte modules for Numeric with
      numeric/times.rb and numeric/bytes.rb (I've been informed that
      thanks go to Richard Kilmer for this. Thanks!)
    * Added numeric/octet_unit which utilizes numeric/bytes.
      (The name of this method may change in the future though.)
    * Added enumerable/uniq_by.
    * Added module/abstract.
    * Added module/redirect which is similar to alias, but does not
      copy the method, but rather wraps it. It also takes a hash so
      multiple methods can be redirected all at once.
    * Added string/shatter which is similar to split but includes
      the matched portions of text.

== 0.6.1 | Florian's Mixes

Changes:

    * Updated the current set of mix files which were still from
      version 0.5.0. (2004-12-31)


== 0.6.0 | Florian's Onslaught

Changes:

    * Major revisions made by Florian's onslaught. (2004-12-28)
    * First general public release.


== 0.5.0 | Fit for First

Changes:

    * This is the beginning of offical releases. (2004-12-23)
    * Now called Facets.
    * Changed layout to be completely atomic! (2004-10-30)


== 0.4.0 | Raspberry

Changes:

    * Scoured the Ruby world for useful additions.
    * Changed name again from A.B.C. to Raspberry.
      I can't seem to settle on a name. Even the new
      subsections have changed five times. (2004-08-08)
    * Adjusted Tuple to use Tuple::[*args] instead of ::new, which now takes
      a single argument instead, either an Array or a String which it splits.
    * Removed services.rb unitl in gets fixed and a better name.


== 0.3.3 | Mega2

Changes:

    * Added inheritable.rb, a lib for creating class vars inherit from ancestors
    * Addes annotations.rb, a lightweight metadata system good for annotating
      methods esspecially. It is built on top of inheritable.rb.


== 0.3.2 | Mega

Changes:

    * Added services.rb, a lib for managing methods as first class objects
    * Fixed/cleaned-up orm_supprt.rb

== 0.3.1

Changes:

    * Aliased #autoload_classes with #autorequire.
    * Added #strfbits and #strfbytes to binary_multiplers.rb.


== 0.3.0 | ABC

Changes:

    * Reorganinzed all of this together in a nice neat way.
    * Changed name of library from Succ to A.B.C.
      which stands for All Base Common. (2004-02-02)
    * Name change to Mega Modules!
    * Added a few important files: multipliers.rb, binary_multipliers.rb,
      time_in_english.rb and orm_inlectors.rb.
    * Each one of these is a "Methods Module", i.e. They are a collection of
      closely related methods that modify one or more core classes/modules.
      Individually these methods could have very well ended up in Nano Methods,
      but given there quantity and interrelation they were more suitable to a
      module, and thus placed here.


== 0.2.0 | Succ

Changes:

    * A number of new methods added.
    * Renamed it Succ for "successor". (2003-05-31)
    * Initial public release


== 0.1.0 | Carats

Changes:

    * Early Development as Ruby Carats


== 0.0.0 | 2002-07-01 | TomsLib

Changes:

    * Tomslib's just a few useful methods.
