# = Multiton
#
# == Synopsis
#
# Multiton design pattern ensures only one object is allocated for a given state.
#
# The 'multiton' pattern is similar to a singleton, but instead of only one
# instance, there are several similar instances.  It is useful when you want to
# avoid constructing objects many times because of some huge expense (connecting
# to a database for example), require a set of similar but not identical
# objects, and cannot easily control how many times a contructor may be called.
#
#   class SomeMultitonClass
#     include Multiton
#     attr :arg
#     def initialize(arg)
#       @arg = arg
#     end
#   end
#
#   a = SomeMultitonClass.new(4)
#   b = SomeMultitonClass.new(4)   # a and b are same object
#   c = SomeMultitonClass.new(2)   # c is a different object
#
# == Previous Behavior
#
# In previous versions of Multiton the #new method was made
# private and #instance had to be used in its stay --just like Singleton.
# But this is less desirable for Multiton since Multitions can
# have multiple instances, not just one.
#
# So instead Multiton now defines #create as a private alias of
# the original #new method (just in case it is needed) and then
# defines #new to handle the multiton; #instance is provided
# as an alias for it.
#
#--
# So if you must have the old behavior, all you need do is re-alias
# #new to #create and privatize it.
#
#   class SomeMultitonClass
#     include Multiton
#     alias_method :new, :create
#     private :new
#     ...
#   end
#
# Then only #instance will be available for creating the Multiton.
#++
#
# == How It Works
#
# A pool of objects is searched for a previously cached object,
# if one is not found we construct one and cache it in the pool
# based on class and the args given to the contructor.
#
# A limitation of this approach is that it is impossible to
# detect if different blocks were given to a contructor (if it takes a
# block).  So it is the constructor arguments _only_ which determine
# the uniqueness of an object. To workaround this, define the _class_
# method ::multiton_id.
#
#   def SomeMultitonClass.multiton_id(*args, &block)
#     # ...
#   end
#
# Which should return a hash key used to identify the object being
# constructed as (not) unique.
