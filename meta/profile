  Facets is the premier collection of extension methods for the Ruby
  programming language. Facets extensions are unique by virtue of thier
  atomicity. They are stored in individual files allowing for highly granular
  control of requirements. In addition, Facets includes a few additional
  classes and mixins suitable to wide variety of applications.
