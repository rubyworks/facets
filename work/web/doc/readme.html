  &quot;ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO RUBY&quot;
</pre>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Ruby Facets is the single largest collection of general purpose method
extensions and system additions for the Ruby programming language.
</p>
<p>
The core extensions is a large collection of methods which extend the core
capabilities of Ruby&#8217;s built-in classes and modules. This collection
of extension methods are unique by virtue of their atomicity. The methods
are stored in relatively small groups of tightly coupled methods so that
each can be required independently. This gives developers the potential for
much finer control over which extra methods to bring into their code.
</p>
<p>
The &quot;more&quot; additions are a collection of classes, modules and
light meta-systems which constitutes an ever improving source of reusable
components. Some very nice additions are provided, from the simple Functor
class to a full-blown annotations system.
</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
Facets has special documentation needs due to it&#8217;s extensive bredth.
For this reason, RDocs are not automatically generated when installing via
RubyGems. Unfortunatgely this also prevents RI docs from being created.
Hopefully we can remedy this in the future. In the mean time you can
manually create them by navigating to the package directory (either the gem
or tgz) and running &#8216;rdoc &#8212;ri-site&#8217; (recommended
destination).
</p>
<p>
Online documentaiton is available at
http://facets.rubyforge.org/learn.html. There is a &quot;Quick Doc&quot;
feature that can be a bit more convenient then the usual RDocs. Prior to
2.3.1 off-line docs had to be downloaded via a separate package, but this
is no longer the case. I&#8217;ve seen past the stigma of not including
documentation along with the package itself (the extra 500K isn&#8217;t
even a floppy disk folks!), so you will find them in the doc/ directory of
whatever package you have choosen to install. In fact, a good package
installer should give you the option to install those in the appropriate
place in your system (eg. in /usr/share/doc/facets/).
</p>
<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<p>
Please see the NEWS file.
</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>
Please see the CHANGES file.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to install is via RubyGems.
</p>
<pre>
  $ gem install facets
</pre>
<p>
To install manually, download and unpack the .tar.gz package and use the
included task/install script. Eg.
</p>
<pre>
  $ tar -xvzf facets-2.x.x.tar.gz
  $ cd facets-2.x.x
  $ sudo task/setup
</pre>
<p>
On Window the last step will be:
</p>
<pre>
  C:\&gt; ruby task/setup
</pre>
<p>
IMPORTANT! Note that setup.rb is no longer used b/c of Facets&#8217; new
layout.
</p>
<h2>Compatibility with 1.x series.</h2>
<p>
Prior to 2.0, Facets was divided between CORE and MORE &#8212;standalone
extensions vs. classes and modules, respectively. With 2.0, the notion of
&quot;CORE&quot; has taken on a slightly different meaning. Instead CORE
now consists of the libraries that are thought essential and as such are
loaded automatically when using ++require &quot;facets&quot;++. While still
primarily made up of extension methods modules and classes may now belong
to core as well.
</p>
<p>
The other significant change from 1.x to 2.0 is the removal of some
libraries that were considered too extraneous for a general purpose
library. Most of these were spun-off to their own projects. In particular,
the web-related libs are now part of Blow (http://blow.rubyforge.org),
inflection libraries are in English (http://english.rubyforge.org),
units.rb along with constants.rb are in Stick (http://stick.rubyforge.org),
and the persistance system in Opod (http://opod.rubyforge.org).
</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
Facets holds to the notion that the more we can reasonably integrate into a
common foundation directed toward general needs, the better that foundation
will be able to serve everyone. There are a number of advantages here:
</p>
<pre>
    * Better Code-reuse
    * Collaborative Improvements
    * Greater Name Consistency
    * One-stop Shop and Installation
</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
For information in usage, please see the special README for the specific
set of libraries:
</p>
<pre>
  README.core     Core extensions
  README.lore     Standard extensions
  README.more     Additions
</pre>
<p>
Using a Facets/MORE library of modules, classes or microframeworks is
essentially the same. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/basicobject'
</pre>
<p>
Again, for details pertaining to the functionality of each feature, please
see the API Docs.
</p>
<h2>Contribute</h2>
<p>
This project thrives on contribution.
</p>
<p>
If you have any extension methods, classes, modules or small frameworks
that you think have general applicability and would like to see them
included in this project, don&#8217;t hesitiate to submit. There&#8217;s a
very good chance they will be included. Also, if you have better versions
of any thing already included or simply have a patch, they too are more
than welcome. We want Ruby Facets to be of the highest quality.
