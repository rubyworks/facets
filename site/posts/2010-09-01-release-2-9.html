  <h2>Facets 2.9 Release</h2>

  <p>Facets 2.9 is fairly extensive as it was originally intended to be v3.0.
After further consideration it was decided to reserve v3.0 for something a
little bolder (to be announced). The primary goal of this release was to
trim Facets down to a true core extensions library. All tertiary add-on classes
and mixins have now been spun-off to other projects. Only a very select set of
general purposes classes and mixins remain.</p>

<p>A new <em>TOUR</em> library division has been added to complement <em>CORE</em> and <em>MORE</em>.
This division houses purely optional extensions. The new division serves
a couple of useful purposes. In particular, it helps separates the standard
library extensions from optional core extension in the RDocs and thus makes
the perfect place to vet new extension ideas.</p>

<p>One important change that will effect anyone using Facets along side
ActiveSupport is that Facets no longer tries to conditionally avoid
method overlaps with ActiveSupport. This is fine for the upcoming
ActiveSupport 3.0 library which extends core classes directly instead of
using mixins. One need only require 'facets' in Rails' config/preinitializer.rb
file, and ActiveSupport will take precedence over Facets. For older versions
of ActiveSupport, the best approach is to cherry pick from Facets just the
extensions you want, thus avoiding any conflicts. There are actually only a
dozen or so overlaps and all are intended to compatible, but it doesn't hurt
to be sure.</p>

<p>I won't detail each change here, have a look at the HISTORY.rdoc file for that.
Needless to say, it's a good idea to read it over to see what changes might
effect you usage --and it also gives you a glimpse at what other extensions are
available that you might not yet be familiar.</p>
