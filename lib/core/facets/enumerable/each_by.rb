module Enumerable

  # Iterate through slices. If slice +steps+ is not

  #   x = []
  #   [1,2,3,4].each_by{ |a,b| x << [a,b] }
  #   x  #=> [ [1,2], [3,4] ]

  #   x  #=> [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6] ]

  # This is just like each_slice, except that it will check
  # the arity of the block. If each_slice ever suppots this
  # this method can be deprecated.
