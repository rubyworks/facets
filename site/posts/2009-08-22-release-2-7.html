  <h2>Facets 2.7 is a Significant Release</h2>

  <p>Facets 2.7 is most significant release of Facets since 2.4. Rather then trickle-release
these changes over the course of the 2.6.x series, I made the decision to let 2.7 have them
all at once. In so doing this release nearly completes the process of trimming down
the MORE library to its essentials. Over 40 high-level libraries have been spun-off
as separate gems and/or deprecated. No doubt this is a big change for Facets, and the
transition may be a bit bumpy over the short-term, but I am certain that in the long-run
everyone involved will be better served. To help, I have listed the effected libraries
and the alternate gems available to take their place.</p>

<p>A few other changes have also been made in the release that may also effect your code.
In particular you should note that #class_extension has been renamed to #class_extend
(require 'facets/class_extend'). In addition we have added a few new core methods such
as Exception#raised? and Symbol#thrown?.</p>

<h2>Spun-Off Projects</h2>

<p>These libraries have been deprecated from Facets entirely, but are available
as separate gems (or soon will be).</p>

<pre><code>LIBRARY               GEM
-------------------   -------------------------
overload.rb           overload

basex.rb              radix
minitar.rb            archive-tar-minitar, folio
</code></pre>

<h2>Spun-Off But Still Available</h2>

<p>These libraries have been spun-off into stand-alone gems, but remain
available via Facets too. Ultimately some of these will be removed
from Facets too (in particular the ansi libraries).</p>

<pre><code>LIBRARY               GEM
-------------------   -------------------------
ansicode.rb           ansi
progressbar.rb        ansi
logger.rb             ansi
tracepoint.rb         tracepoint
dictionary.rb         dictionary
recorder.rb           recorder
ostructable.rb        ostructable, openhash
openobject.rb         openhash
opencollection.rb     openhash
opencascade.rb        openhash
openhash.rb           openhash
openmodule.rb         openmodule
fileable.rb           fileable
expirable.rb          expirable
enumerablepass.rb     enumargs
</code></pre>

<h2>Deprecations Without Current Replacement</h2>

<p>The libraries have been deprecated but do not yet have replacements.
Separate gems for these are planned though.</p>

<pre><code>* bbcode.rb
* ini.rb
* settings.rb
* xmlhash.rb
</code></pre>

<h2>Deprecations Merged Into CORE</h2>

<p>These libraries have been deprecated because their functionality was merged into
the CORE library and/or made available in some another way.</p>

<pre><code>* 1stclassmethod.rb   #method! and #instance_method! are now part of CORE.
* elementor.rb        #per has been added to CORE.
* elementwise.rb      #ewise has been added to CORE.
* consoleutils.rb     #ask is in CORE, for the rest see Ansi or Clio project.
* attr.rb             Added Module#attr_setter to CORE, and separated the rest in MORE.
</code></pre>

<h2>General Deprecations</h2>

<p>These libraries have simply been deprecated because they were found lacking in
some significant fashion.</p>

<pre><code>* nilstatus.rb        Poved rather useless, not to mention trivial.
* heap.rb             Heap was just an alias for PQueue anyway. Use 'pqueue' instead.
* dependency.rb       Other solutions exist that are much better (like Advisable).
* classmethods.rb     #class_extend solution is more robust.
* ziputils.rb         Have a look at Folio (gem install folio) for replacement.
* unheritable.rb      Implementation is trivial and usefulness questionable.
* instantise.rb       Replaced by instance_function.rb.
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to all this we've also taken some time to ensure Ruby Facets is more compatible
with Ruby 1.9 --indeed, at this point, it should be very close to fully compatibility. In
the process of doing this, btw, it has become clear that Ruby 1.9 picked up a good number
of methods already supported by Facets (some with the same exact names and some with
changed names). There's no way to know if Facets had any influence in these additions
to 1.9, but at the very least we can be sure that Facets contributed to "airing the field"
that led to their addition. That's a great thing, as it means Facets is directly contributing
to Ruby's future. I hope that will continue.</p>
